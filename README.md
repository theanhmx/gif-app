## Details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
I utilized the @giphy/react-components, I think no need to re-invent the wheel here.

I'm using my personal API key so there is limit only 10 uploads per day.
What challenged me was to create the page layouts, i'm not very good as creativity so I followed the styles of the Giphy page.

## If I have more time

I would refactor the styling a bit, utilize more scss features.\
I would try to test the Root route that it should get trending gifs when render and searches too.
