# About

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I utilized the @giphy/react-components too.

I'm using my personal API key so there is limit only 10 uploads per day.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Time Spent

7hr

## If I have more time

I would refactor the styling a bit, utilize more scss features
I would try to test the Root route that it should get trending gifs when render and searches too.
